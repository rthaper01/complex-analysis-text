# complex-analysis-text
This is a comprehensive collection of notes on complex analysis, typeset in Latex and with diagrams drawn in Asymptote, in preparation for Stanford University's MATH 116 course. The material is taken directly from Lars Ahlfors' classic 1952 textbook on the subject, and full solutions to selected exercises are provided.

This repository contains only the source code. To view the notes as a PDF, including all diagrams and solutions, simply download the source (very important: do not forget the .latexmkrc file; it automates the Asymptote workflow), and build the project in your favorite IDE (or run "pdflatex complex-analysis.tex" on the command line). Asymptote diagrams will be generated in their own source files and compiled to PDFs, and the entire document will also appear as a PDF.
