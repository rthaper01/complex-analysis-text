\chapter*{Preface}
The following is a collection of notes I compiled while reading through Lars Ahlfors' classic text \textit{Complex Analysis} during the summer of 2025, in preparation of Stanford's MATH 116 course of the same name.

The quarter system at Stanford, in my opinion, is not optimal for a mathematics degree: a semester's worth of material is crammed into ten weeks of instruction, with a midterm and final exam. Because of this insanely fast pace, I have found that I learn mathematics best when I prepare independently of coursework, taking the time to absorb the concepts with no pressure of handing in assignments every week.

To that end, this forms part of a series of notes I intend to organize on an array of upper-level subjects, including algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and differential topology.
